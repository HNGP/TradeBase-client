TradeBase is a web app which tracks stocks youâ€™ve invested in, shows when they rise or drop and also gives you new opportunities to trade. Stock data is updated in realtime, in a time series and represented on a histogram. You can pin stocks into the homepage and watch them constantly, and search for new stocks, all with a very clean, intuitive UI and UX.

Card based UI with SVG Animations, blurs, shadows and component based architecture.
Authentication using JWT, with sessions. 
Stock data provided by freemium AlphaVantage API, charts designed in Plotly.js, News provided by NewsAPI

Known Issues:
- Not fully responsive UI
